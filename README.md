# Carousel.js

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ndaversa/carousel.js.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ndaversa/carousel.js)

## Testing

Install [Node](http://nodejs.org) (comes with npm) and Bower.

From the repo root, install the project's development dependencies:

```
npm install
bower install
```

Testing relies on the Karma test-runner. If you'd like to use Karma to
automatically watch and re-run the test file during development, it's easiest
to globally install Karma and run it from the CLI.

```
npm install -g karma
karma start
```

To run the tests in Firefox, just once, as CI would:

```
npm test
```

## Browser support

* Google Chrome (latest)
* More TBD
